    role: Tech Lead
    bio: I love Functional Programming, as it allows to express modularity in its essence, to focus on the core of problems, to generalize solutions, and to express (mathematical) reasoning, resulting ultimately in a significant productivity gain. I am transitioning more and more towards Scala (from Java), of which I love expressiveness, conciseness, strong type system.

    role: CTO
    bio: From Sardinia, with love. I'm a seasoned developer who craves functional excellence as much as attention to the aesthetics of the technical solution. I have been working with web technologies so long that I almost forgot my secret C++ and J2ME past. Nowadays I'm a Clojure advocate, I love organising tech events and surround myself with brilliant people.
