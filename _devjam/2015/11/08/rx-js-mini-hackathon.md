title: An RxJS mini hackathon
description: > #
    After the great introduction of RxJS from our friends at
    <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Reactive-Amsterdam/events/226771352/">Reactive Amsterdam</a>
    we decided to keep studying. Tonight we meet to hack together some code to experiment
    with <a hrnf="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">Reactive Extensions</a>.

[Reactive Extensions][1] defined a fundamental interaction pattern for your APIs that expand on the [Observer Pattern][2] to allow for asynchronous, just in time processing of data as it becomes available, as well as enabling [back pressure][3] and thus paving the way described by the [Reactive Manifesto][4].

Tonight, we will spend some quality nerd time by hacking together on a few sample projects to study [RxJS][5] and how to apply it to our daily JS development tasks.

To fully enjoy this hackathon, make sure to bring your laptop. Basic knowledge of JavaScript is very helpful, but not a requirement: keeping an open mind will suffice.
