[ElasticSearch][1] is all the rage when it comes to search engines. Its flexibility and its cloud friendly clustering model makes it a great addition to your application.

This workshop will give us the possibility to try out ElasticSearch and how to apply it to solve common soarch problems. As part of the workshop, you will also try out a couple other products from the ElasticSearch ecosystem, namely Logstash and Kibana.

To fully enjoy this workshop, make sure to have:

- a laptop :-)
- an installed JDK v1.7 or above
- the [distribution package][2] for ElasticSearch v1.7.2 or above
